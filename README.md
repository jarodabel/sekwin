SEKWIN (Southeast Kansas Women's Intersectional Network) is a local grassroots feminist organization formed to encourage intersectional feminism in Southeast Kansas.

SEKWIN is focused on seven core issues: constitutional equality, reproductive rights and justice, racial justice, LGBTQ+ rights, ending domestic violence, economic justice, and environmental stewardship advocacy. This purpose includes, but is not limited to, acknowledging the differences among women and how overlapping identities impact oppression and discrimination, equal rights, and responsibilities in all aspects of citizenship, public service, employment, education, family life, and freedom from discrimination because of race, ethnic origin, age, marital status, gender identity, or parenthood.

We currently meet the first Wednesday of the month at 6 p.m. at Pittsburg Public Library.

This group is for sharing articles, videos, events, etc., relevant to feminism or any of the priority issues listed above and for discussing these issues.

Posts listing items for sale or promoting a business will be removed.

Dues are $60 for the year, or $5 for a month ($5 per month up to the current month to be an active member) and can be paid in person at meetings, by mail to our P.O Box, or online at paypal.me/sekwin.
